# Security HW 3
### By Federick Gonzalez

To run this project, please make sure the permissions for `create-tree.sh` are properly set as -rwxrwxr-x. If the permissions aren't properly set, please run `chmod +x create-tree.sh`. Once this has been done, simply input the following command: `make DEST=destination`, where destination is the name of the email directory you wish to create. After this is done, edit tests.sh if you wish to add tests, and then simply run `make tests DEST=destination` where destination is the name of the email directory you wish to test. The test script should output the expected results, and should end on an error code of 1, as one of the test scripts will end the program if it finds no messages.
