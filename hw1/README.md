# Homework 1
## Federick Gonzalez, fag2113

In order to run cstore, please type either `make all` or `make` followed by `make install`. To run tests, edit test.sh and run `make test`. 

This cstore program creates a file archive in the form of a directory, with hidden files .filenames and .code which include the files included in the directory and the hmac of the entire directory, respectively. I was debating writing all of the files into one single, long document, but I decided it would be possible to remove some of the file and still pass an integrity check, so I believed both for ease of processing and security reasons I would create a directory. I experimented with different permissions but it seemed I was unable to consistently write and read with other mkdir permissions than 0755, which does allow others to look inside, however if they try to read a file they will be unable to do so, as each file is stored in its encrypted state. I used AES encryption and implemented CBC, just in case repeated bytes appear in my file and ent up helping an attacker decrypt my file. I also used an HMAC for integrity checking because it was the one I understood the most. In order to integrity check, I encrypted the user submitted password with sha256 10001 times, created a key, and used that key to calculate an hmac code when reading files and when writing files. When writing, I hmac the entire archive and store it in .code, and read from .code when trying to verify user passwords on any other iterations.
